# What i learend form the lecture :-
 **Help people**, the developer should make a software thats help people in thier life not oly to show how much he intelligent.
**A good Desgin** for the software which gives a good or bad view.
The understanding of the requiremt selecting the good progreammer or the bad one, and how the code and the explation simple makes the code simple too much to read or detect a bugs, which is on other hand more complexity codes make a lot of work like a simple project need 1 month to finish it gonna take more than 3 months to finish it up, the main goal is to create code with less complexity, this guide us to the maintenance part which is the most important because when your are coding and editing and changing in your code you have to maintenance it before yu finish it.
your code should be consistent so the developer dont have to relearn your code to understand it.
If i have to chabge something in my code and bring me a good result and less effort that will be better. when you facing a problem and you dont how to solve it you should start piece by piece to fix it not at one time.always dont put yourself in problems with the code and miss the deadline and and got a lot of bugs, ***everything should be perfect*** start small and extend it.dont work so far be *genric* so you dont have to make  a code for a future because this idea will not work in future so spend effort for nothing. Don't Reinvent the wheel unlees you need something dosen't exist or not consistent and too old.
dont spend time on repetitive tasks 
*If you can automate it, automate it.*
Always Remember to avoid long line of codes.
Dont try to guess the result without test the code 
***Untested code is the code that doesnâ€™t work***
while you taking a parts of the code you dont take a long time.
rewriting codes takes a long time and effort so you dont have to rewrite from scratch.
the main goal of comment codes is to write why you did this not what this code doing.
try more than one programming language try some tools some features dont stay on uniqe programming language.
***And always remember dont ask  qusetions ask for help*** 
you dont need the solutuoin to develop yourself you need some advice to know how to fix something and that help you to get better.
